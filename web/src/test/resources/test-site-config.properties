# -- ID Schemes --
# Prefix: This can be a custom string of characters to be 
# be placed at the beginning of an id when it's generated
#
# Check Digit: This will generate a check character once
# the id has been formed
#
# Increment Bound: This will continue to generate an id
# up to a certain bound. Example: an increment bound of
# 99 would generate up to 99 id's of the same format.
# MBI01, MBI02, ... MBI99.
#
# UseGenerator: This will ensure that the system will use the 
# provided generator classes to create the id. If turned off, 
# the system cannot guarantee that the id entered is of
# correct format since the user will be required to enter it
# manually.
#
# To configure the ordering of fields in which an id can be formed,
# it will require modifying the application-context.xml

# Location
# This configuration generates id's that take the following form:
# If the Location Hierarchy is specified to be MBINGU:
