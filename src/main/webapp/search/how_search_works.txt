This folder has a searchBox.xhtml facelet fragment that can be added to any search page.
It is a generic implementation based on EntityCrudImpl fields and methods.

To add the search box to a list, you have to specify the specific entitycrud backing bean for that form.

e.g.
           <!-- Search Widget -->
           <ui:include src="/search/searchBox.xhtml">
               <ui:param name="crud" value="#{locationCrud}"/>
           </ui:include>
